# hello-world
first repository of mine
Hello guys! My name is Bakhshillo Ataev. I have started my journey to the programming world, 4 months ago. It was just out of curiosity, but now, I have decided to become a software developer. Currently, I am taking Udacity courses on Front-end. I have got basic HTML and CSS knowledge. And laying foundation of my JS knowledge.
